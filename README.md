# rfiddoorlockarduino
This is an RFID Based Arduino Project.

RFID To Arduino:

SDA	= D10
SCK	= D13
MOSI = D11
MISO = D12
IRQ	= Not connected
GND	= GND
RST =	D9
3.3V = 3.3V
âš  Only Use 3.3V, Not 5V.

Extra Components To Arduino:

Buzzer = Pin 6
Red_Led = Pin 7
Green_Led = Pin 8

Make Sure To Use 220Ohm Resisters for the LEDs.
